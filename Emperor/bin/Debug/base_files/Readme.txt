You can place an unmodified copy of Emperor.exe in this folder and it will be used to create a patched EXE if you don't select a specific Emperor.exe in the file picker window.

If you also place a copy of EmperorText.eng in this folder, that will be patched as well if the "Patch EmperorText.eng" is selected.
