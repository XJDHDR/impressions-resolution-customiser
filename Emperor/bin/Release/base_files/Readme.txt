You can place an unmodified copy of Emperor.exe in this folder and it will be used to create a patched EXE if you don't select a specific Emperor.exe in the file picker window.

You should also place a copy of EmperorText.engin this folder so that the game's display options menu will be patched to display the correct resolution values instead of "1024x768".
