You can place an unmodified copy of Zeus.exe in this folder, and it will be used to create a patched EXE if you don't select a specific Zeus.exe in the file picker window.

You should also place a copy of Zeus_Text.eng in this folder so that the game's display options menu will be patched to display the correct resolution values instead of "1024x768".
