			// To explain what this code does, I'll quote what Pecunia (who discovered how to fix these bugs) said to me:
			// https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=172648#p172648
			//
			// Some animation basics:
			// - Real-time animations are based on (a multiple of) a 20 millisecond update cycle
			// - Every 20ms, a flag is set for that render-cycle, indicating that the animation can be advanced
			// - Some figures in the game, notably gods and urchin collectors, use these (real-time) animations to advance their (game-time) actions
			//
			// This worked well in 2000 when there was one render-cycle per 20ms, such that an animation update coincided with a "game time" advance.
			// With modern hardware, we have multiple render cycles per 20ms interval, causing the game ticks to 'miss' their animation update and thus act incredibly slow.
			//
			// The 0x64(100) is the parameter that tells the game: "advance this figure ONLY if the animation should advance as well".
			// Since that no longer works properly with today's hardware, I changed it to "0", meaning: "always advance". Somehow this worked perfectly well gameplay-wise,
			// so it was an easy patch to make. Finding this quirk, however, took me about half a year of reading assembly, plus a year of trying to get GOG to incorporate
			// my fixes in the official distribution ("our techs will look at it soon", "really, it'll be soon"), before giving up and releasing it myself.
