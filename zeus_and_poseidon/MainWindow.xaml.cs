		// Max Height = (127 - 1) * 15 + 30 = 1920

		// However, higher resolutions will cause the playable portions of the game's window to take up a progressively smaller part of the screen.
		// As a result, I will cap these numbers at 3x higher than the calculated figures above. This means that the game's playable area will
		// always take up at least 11.1% of the screen.
